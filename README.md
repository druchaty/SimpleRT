# SimpleRT
[![Build and release](https://github.com/robinpaulson/SimpleRT/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/robinpaulson/SimpleRT/actions/workflows/android.yml)

Reverse [Tethering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering) utility for Android.

Provides a way to share a computer's internet connection with an Android device via a USB cable.

Development is still in progress, bugs and errors can occur.

```
FIRST RUN: check out -h option
   simple-rt -h
   usage: sudo ./simple-rt [-h] [-i interface] [-n nameserver|"local" ]
   default params: -i eth0 -n 8.8.8.8
```

```
IMPORTANT
   If you have any issues with this tool, please, provide some logs:
   - run util in debug mode (-d), connect your device
   - run "ip addr show"
   - run "ip route show"
   - store this output into issue ticket on github
```

### No root or adb required

## Full Linux and macOS support. Windows version is being researched.

   Current version features:
   - Multi-tether. It is possible to connect several android devices into one virtual network
   - DNS server can be specified (custom or system one).

The SimpleRT utility consists of 2 parts:

- Android part:

   Implemented as a standalone service, no gui, no activities

   Dependencies:
   - Android 4.0 and higher.

   Build system based on gradle + gradle experimental android plugin (supporting ndk). To build, both sdk & ndk are required.
Create local.properties file in root dir, it should look like this:
   ```
   ndk.dir=/home/viper/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle
   sdk.dir=/home/viper/Android/Sdk
   ```
   build:
   ```
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk is your apk.

   ## Now available in [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=simplert&fdid=com.viper.simplert)
   A prebuilt apk can also be found under `Downloads` at the [Github releases](https://github.com/iteratec/SimpleRT/releases)
   tab.

- Desktop part:

   Dependencies:
   - libusb-1.0
   - libresolv (usually already present in both linux and macos)
   - tuntap kernel module (linux version), utun (macos version, builtin)

   before build (debian-based example):
   ```
   sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev
   ```

   Makefile is universal for all platforms, just type "make && make install" to install it in prefix /usr/local and
   check /usr/local/sbin is in your PATH-variable.  
   If you want to change the prefix path eg. to install it in /usr instead of /usr/local you can
   type "make prefix=/usr && make prefix=/usr install".  
   If you don't want to install but just run it from within build directory you can type "make iface_up_sh_path=.".

Usage:

- run console util as root (sudo simple-rt). The iface_up.sh file needs to be present in the application folder.
- connect your android device

First connection requires some trivial steps:

![Second step](screens/vpn.png)

![Third step](screens/connected.png)

Issues: Some apps do not recognize the reverse tethered internet connection due to ConnectivityManager policy. Leave the WiFi or mobile data connection active, the connection through SimpleRT will be prioritised.
